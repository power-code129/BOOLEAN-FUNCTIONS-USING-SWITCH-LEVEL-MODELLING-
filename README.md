# BOOLEAN FUNCTIONS USING SWITCH LEVEL MODELLING
## AIM: 
To design and implement a 4-variable Boolean function  using switch-level modeling in Verilog by constructing the circuit with PMOS and NMOS transistors and simulating it to verify the logical functionality. 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED: 
1. Visual Studio Code 
2. Icarus Verilog  
3. Gtkwave (simulation) 
4. PC 
## THEORY: 
Switch-level modeling in Verilog simulates the behavior of circuits using MOSFET transistors (PMOS/NMOS). It is more detailed than gate-level modeling and is typically used to reflect real hardware logic using transmission gates (nmos, pmos, pullup, pulldown primitives).NMOS passes strong 0 when gate is high.PMOS passes strong 1 when gate is low.Transmission Gates combine NMOS and PMOS for bidirectional flow.Wires are connected with supply1 and supply0 as power and ground.
